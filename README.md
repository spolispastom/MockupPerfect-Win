# MockupPerfect
The application for verification ios applications mockup.

This application is able to do only one thing to show it a picture of a semi-transparent background, so that you could apply it to the simulator to check whether there are differences between the screen and the application that drew the designer.

The application window can be adjusted to fit different simulators and change the transparency. Another window can be moved by the arrows that allow you to accurately align it with the simulator window.
And then there are shortcuts.

That's all. That's all that it s an application.
